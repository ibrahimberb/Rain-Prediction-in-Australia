# Rain Prediction in Australia

The aim of this data science project is to predict next-day rain status by training classification models on the target variable `RainTomorrow`. 

In this project, following two classification algorithms are compared:

1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Logistic Regression

Data preprocessing, analysis and implementation of both classification algorithms were performed via [Knime Analytic Tool](https://www.knime.com). Additionally, for some visualizations, Jupyter notebook is used with `pandas` and `matplotlib` libraries.

The dataset can be found by [this](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) link.

This project is uploaded for CS 447 Introduction to Data Science course.
